          <h2>
            Russia a 'paper tiger': How Trump changed his position on Ukraine,
            NATO
          </h2> <br>
          <h4>
            Trump's most recent flip-flop comes after a meeting with Ukrainian
            President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the UNGA sidelines.</b>
          </h4> <br>
          <p>
            Trump posted on his Truth Social platform on Tuesday following a
            meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the
            sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA): “I think
            Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to
            fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form.” Trump even
            mentioned NATO, which he has often criticised in the past: “With
            time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in
            particular, NATO, the original Borders from where this War started,
            is very much an option.” He also took aim at Russia, saying it has
            been fighting the war “aimlessly” and looks like a “paper tiger”. A
            paper tiger is someone or something which appears intimidating but
            does not pose much of a real threat. The war in Ukraine has raged
            since February 2022, when Russia launched a full-scale invasion into
            the country, which it described as a “special military operation”.
            Trump said that the war would have taken a “Real Military Power”
            less than a week to win. “Ukraine would be able to take back their
            Country in its original form and, who knows, maybe even go further
            than that! Putin and Russia are in BIG Economic trouble, and this is
            the time for Ukraine to act.”

          <h4>President Xi Jinping told a U.N. climate conference that his country would seek to reduce emissions by at least 7 to 10 percent by 2035. 
            Ukraine's president appealed for more weapons to fight Russia and warned of the dangers of a new arms race.</h4> <br>
          <p>
            China, the world's largest carbon polluter, announced at the United Nations 
            on Wednesday that it intended to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 7 percent 
            to 10 percent over the next 10 years, the first time Beijing has made such a strong commitment to halt global warming.
            The Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, made the announcement by video at a U.N. climate summit in New York, where he said, 
            “Green and low carbon transition is the trend of our time.” In an apparent reference to the United States, Mr. Xi added, “Some countries are against it.”

          <h2>CISA Shares Lessons Learned from an Incident Response Engagement</h2> <br>
          <h3>Introduction</h3> <br>
          <p>Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is releasing this Cybersecurity 
            Advisory to highlight lessons learned from an incident response engagement CISA conducted 
            at a U.S. federal civilian executive branch (FCEB) agency. CISA is publicizing this advisory 
            to reinforce the importance of prompt patching, as well as preparing for incidents by practicing 
            incident response plans and by implementing logging and aggregating logs in a centralized out-of-band 
            location. CISA is also raising awareness about the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed 
            by these cyber threat actors to help organizations safeguard against similar exploits. <br>
            CISA began incident response efforts at an FCEB agency after the agency identified potential 
            malicious activity through security alerts generated by the agency's endpoint detection and response (EDR) tool. 
            CISA discovered cyber threat actors compromised the agency by exploiting CVE-2024-36401 in a GeoServer about three weeks 
            prior to the EDR alerts. Over the three-week period, the cyber threat actors gained separate initial access to a second GeoServer 
            via the same vulnerability and moved laterally to two other servers.

          <h2>Open Source Infrastructure is Breaking Down Due to Corporate Freeloading</h2> <br>
          <h4>An unprecedented threat looms over open source.</h4> <br>
          <p>
            Open source software powers everything. Your smartphone runs on Linux. Your favorite websites 
            depend on JavaScript frameworks. Your company's servers rely on countless libraries pulled from 
            places like Maven Central, PyPI, npm, and other package registries. Heck, even the infrastructure running 
            those registries depends on open source. For decades, this ecosystem has thrived on a simple premise: 
            developers create, share, and improve software together. But somewhere along the way, the balance broke. 
            What started as community-driven collaboration has become a feeding frenzy where massive corporations consume 
            without giving back adequately. Now the people who actually run this infrastructure have had enough. 
            They've come together with an open letter that basically says, Enough is enough.

          <p>
            Elon Musk addressed the pay debate directly on X after a user urged shareholders 
            to back the proposal. He said, “It’s not about ‘compensation,’ but about me having 
            enough influence over Tesla to ensure safety if we build millions of robots.” 
            He added, “If I can just get kicked out in the future by activist shareholder advisory 
            firms who don’t even own Tesla shares themselves, I’m not comfortable with that future.”

          <h2>Hegseth orders hundreds of military commanders to Virginia for unprecedented meeting</h2> <br>
          <h4>Highly unusual gathering comes as War Secretary Hegseth wants to cut 20% of senior officers</h4> <br>
          <p>
            A meeting of this size and scope is highly unusual and would usually take place on a secure video teleconference — 
            around 800 generals and admirals are spread across the U.S. and world. The lack of details surrounding the gathering 
            has some fearing a looming purge. War Secretary Pete Hegseth has previously said he wants to cut 20% of senior generals and admirals. 
            The order, first reported by The Washington Post, applies to senior officers with the rank of brigadier general or above 
            or their Navy equivalent and their top enlisted advisers. In May, Hegseth issued a directive to slash about 100 generals 
            and admirals, along with a "minimum" 20% cut to four-star officers. He ordered an additional 10% reduction in general and 
            flag officers across the military.

          <h2>Texas Tech student arrested, expelled after video shows her 'mocking' Charlie Kirk vigil: officials</h2> <br>
          <h4>University says behavior that 'denigrates victims of violence is reprehensible'</h4> <br>
          <p>
            An 18-year-old Texas Tech student was arrested and expelled after she was caught on video making disturbing comments at a vigil for Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, officials say.

Shocking video shows Camryn Giselle Booker shouting at students gathered Friday near the university's Student Union Building during a vigil for the conservative activist, allegedly yelling, "F--k y’all homie dead, he got shot in the head." 

Booker was arrested and charged with one count of assault, classified as a Class C misdemeanor in Texas — the lowest level of criminal offense, a spokesperson for the Lubbock County Sheriff's Office told Fox News Digital on Monday.

          <h2>Amazon's Worst Nightmare: Shoppers Are Canceling Prime For This Clever Hack</h2> <br>
          <p>
            What if there was a way to potentially find better deals—without paying for Prime? 
            Millions of Americans who have been holding off on online shopping due to inflation 
            and rising prices are now discovering a new way to shop. A free browser tool is helping 
            users uncover savings they might have otherwise missed, and it's quickly gaining popularity across the U.S. 
            Amazon and other retailers may need to rethink their pricing as more shoppers use this tool to compare options before making a purchase.
            Look, we love Amazon Prime (that recently got increased to a whopping $179/year). Free 2-day shipping is great and, 
            like everyone else, we enjoyed not knowing how much it actually cost. Well, guess what? 
            It isn’t free to move items from one location to another, and that cost gets baked into the price you pay. 
            The only thing you have to do is to add Capital One Shopping to your browser! 
            It’s 100% free ​for everyone (no Capital One account required!) and works to find amazing deals, coupons, 
            and price drops out there. And with ‘out there’ we mean searching far and wide across the web. 
            The algorithm behind it is so strong that customers already refer to it as the “insane deals” browser extension. 
            The best thing is: Everyone can use this trick to finally get real deals again!

          <h5>TESLA SECURES 'UNBOXED' PATENT FOR CYBERCAB PRODUCTION! $TSLA</h5>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Tesla has reportedly secured a new manufacturing process patent
              set to be applied in part to the production of its upcoming
              Robotaxi, the Cybercab.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              This patent forms part of Tesla's 'Unboxed' production method, an
              innovative approach where vehicle components are assembled
              individually before being combined in the final stage.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              The patent details include a robotic station that uses vacuum
              clamps to secure parts, applies adhesive, and precisely aligns
              them using reference points.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              The news was first revealed through industry influencers, with
              reports interpreting it as a key element in the Cybercab’s
              production process.
